# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

If you want to help this project grow, please take a look at the invitation issue.

If you have a new feature you want to add, please make a fork and then tell me in the feature issue.

If you do choose to join, then please follow these guide lines:
 - DO NOT mess with the Projects page. It is to visualise progress of development.
 - DO NOT create your own features in this repository! Instead: Fork the project and add it to there. If I can easily merge it, then it will be added.

Thaks for reading this!
