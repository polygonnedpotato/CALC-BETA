# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

If you want to help this project grow, please take a look at the invitation issue.

If you have a new feature you want to add, please make a fork and then tell me in the feature issue.

If you do choose to join, then please follow these guidelines:
 - DO NOT mess with the Projects page. It is to visualise progress of development.
 - DO NOT create your own features in this repository! Instead: Fork the project and add it to there. If I can easily merge it, then it will be added.
 - If you need to report a bug, please rerun the program in debug mode by typing " -d" (with the space) and remember to save all contents of your console window. You will also need a copy of the errinf.md file from the error. it will be in either your user folder or the same folder as CALC. if errinf.md is empty, attempt to trigger the error again and instead of hitting [Enter] at the end, type "failsafe", then hit [Enter]. then follow the instructions.

Thanks for reading this!
